# Linear-Regression-Model

## Description

This repository contains my own Python implementation of a linear regression model. This project aims to demonstrate a fundamental understanding of the linear regression algorithm, its mathematical foundations, and practical applications.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- pip

### Setting Up a Virtual Environment and Installing Dependencies

1. **Install Virtualenv**

   If you don't have `virtualenv` installed, open your terminal (Command Prompt on Windows or Terminal on macOS/Linux) and run:

   ```bash
   pip install virtualenv
   ```

   If the pip command is not found on macOS/Linux, and you have Python 3 installed, use:

   ```bash
   pip3 install virtualenv
   ```
   
2. **Clone the Repository**

   First, clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Linear-Regression-Model.git
   ```

   Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Linear-Regression-Model
   ```
3. **Create a Virtual Environment**

   In the project directory, create a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   virtualenv venv
   ```

   This command creates a new folder `venv` in your project directory, containing the virtual environment.
4. **Activate the Virtual Environment**

   Before installing dependencies, activate the virtual environment:

   - On Windows:

     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - On macOS and Linux:

     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

   Your command prompt should change to indicate that the virtual environment is activated.
5. **Install Project Dependencies**

   With the virtual environment activated, install the project dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

6. **Deactivating the Virtual Environment**

   When you're finished working, you can deactivate the virtual environment:

   ```bash
   deactivate
   ```
